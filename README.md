# WhatsApp Bot SmartFlow

A blueprint repository for building a GPT-powered WhatsApp bot. It focuses on designing clear conversation flowcharts and providing infrastructure logic to integrate large language models with WhatsApp through Twilio.

## Why SmartFlow?

Businesses and creators often need to respond to customer queries on WhatsApp. Hardcoded chatbots fail to handle the nuance of real conversations. SmartFlow solves this by combining structured decision trees with AI-driven responses:
- Plan conversation flows visually before coding.
- Use GPT models for natural language understanding and generation.
- Integrate with Twilio WhatsApp API for message delivery.
- Keep logic modular so you can extend or plug into other services.

## Key Features

- **Flowchart based design:** Describe your conversation as a series of nodes and edges in YAML/JSON files, then render them visually.
- **OpenAI integration:** Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for intent classification, response generation and fallback answers.
- **Twilio & WhatsApp integration:** Send and receive WhatsApp messages using Twilio’s API.
- **Context management:** Maintain conversation context using Supabase or PostgreSQL to deliver coherent, personalized responses.
- **Extensible modules:** Add your own modules for CRM lookups, payment processing, or ticket creation.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js & Express for API and webhook handling
- Supabase & PostgreSQL for data storage and context
- Twilio WhatsApp Business API
- OpenAI GPT models for NLU and generation
- Flowchart DSL (e.g. Mermaid or custom YAML) for describing flows
- Docker for local development and deployment

## Planned Features

- Visual flow builder UI to design conversation graphs
- Analytics dashboard for message statistics and user journeys
- Multi-language support and dynamic translation
- Voice note transcription and audio responses
- Templates for common use cases (customer support, bookings, FAQ)

## Roadmap

| Phase | Description | Planned timeline |
